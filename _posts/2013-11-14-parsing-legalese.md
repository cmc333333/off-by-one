title: "Parsing Legalese: Rules for Rules"
---

One of the core contributions found in the recently released [eregs](http://eregs.github.io/eregulations) project is a plain-text parser for regulations, also known as rules. This parser pulls structure from the documents such that each paragraph can be properly index; it discoveres citations between the paragraphs and to external works; it determines definitions and even calculates differences between versions of the regulation. Due to the nature of the enterprise, we cannot leave room for probablistic methods employed via machine learning. Instead we retrieve all of the information through parsing, a rule-based approach to natural language processing.

## Parser Combinators: Not Actually Scary
